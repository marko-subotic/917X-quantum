cut off the edge of the screw at the very end of the bot to keep within the limits(done)
move the screw for the anti-tipping mechanism back one so you can fold the wheels in properly(done)
add the chains on to the wheels, both chains fell off(done)
put a spacer at the right place on the right wheel so that the axle stops falling out(done)
add a new tray for more cubes (done)
add a side rail just after the intake on the tray so that the cube can't turn sideways (done)
move the lifts to the outside of the gear and move the actual intakes to the inside so the arms stop getting caught on the tray
move the front wheel back so we can stack easier without having to get over the rail area for the stacking
